# Audio Compressor using MATLAB
## OBJECTIVES
The objective of this task is to make a GUI for Audio Compressor i.e. the GUI will take an input signal and compress it and display it on output. The input signal will be shown in first axes and output on 2nd.
## WORKING CONDITIONS:
* I will make a GUI.
* I will take input as an audio signal.
* I will calculate its size.
* Compress the audio signal.
* Display it on axes
* Frequency of the input signal is also change by GUI. 
* First axes will show the input signal 
* Second axes will show the compressed signal
